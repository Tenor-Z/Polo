# Polo
A Pygame arcade game I made in high school. Take control of Polo as he avoids those dastardly black cells while trying to get as strong as he possibly can!

# History
Around my senior year, we had to design a Python game in my computer engineering class. I already made a text-based game, but now we had to use Pygame. Being busy with my minimum wage job at the time, I debated on what kind of game I wanted to make when I finally settled on a Pac-Man esque game. Why are you a cell collecting pills while avoiding black cells? Who the hell knows? I don't think I even knew what I was doing.

Due to being in a rush to complete this for the deadline, this game is buggy and a lot of sprites aren't even used in the game because I was just looking for something that would work for the time. If I could go back and fix this stuff, I would, but I'm lazy so...

# List of Things to Fix
Below is a list of elements that I will need to fix
- Polo moves way too fast
- The game in general is too difficult
- A lot of sprites are sloppy and/or have a lot of white space
- A minor glitch with the 'lives' display
- Some audio is too loud (the static for example)

# Installation
Just clone the repository to your machine and run the main.py file. Pygame is essential for this program to work.
