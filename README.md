A Pygame arcade game I made in High School

Around my senior year, we had to design a Python game in my computer engineering class. I already made a text-based game, but now we had to use Pygame. Being busy with my minimum wage job at the time, I debated on what kind of game I wanted to make when I finally settled on a Pac-Man esque game. Why are you a cell collecting pills while avoiding black cells? Who the hell knows? I don't think I even knew what I was doing.

Due to being in a rush to complete this for the deadline, this game is buggy and a lot of sprites aren't even used in the game because I was just looking for something that would work for the time. If I could go back and fix this stuff, I would, but I'm a lazy shit so...

# Installation
Just fork the repository to your machine and run the main.py file.
MAKE SURE PYGAME IS INSTALLED.
